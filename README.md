# Elden Ring character save file utility to back up character save files. This program will look for character save files and then copy them if found.

# 2. Function for converting Vanilla saves to Seamless - Soon, plan on waiting till Seamless update. May add sooner depending on requests
# 3. Function to assist in the Seamless Co-Op install process - Just like above, waiting on Seamless update
# 4. Function to update existing Seamless Co-Op install - TBD
# 5. Add option for user to define save back up location - Can be added anytime if requested
# 6. Either create GUI, package into a exe or make web based - Based on demand as this tool was originally created with a small group of friends in mind
